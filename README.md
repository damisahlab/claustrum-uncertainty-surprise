# Overview
This repository contains codes and data associated with paper ACC and Claustrum Single Neuron Representations of Salience and Uncertainty by XX et al. 

# Abstract
The human ACC and CLA represent salient events and uncertainty, but the single neuron responses are still not well characterized... 0
